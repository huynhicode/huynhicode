### Hello 💃🏻

I'm a UX Engineer with a deep commitment to enhancing digital experiences. My role involves bridging the gap between design and development, ultimately delivering interactive, user-centered solutions that elevate the overall digital experience.

I am a big fan of open-source technology; here are a few of my favorite tools:

- 🧜‍♀️ [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) - diagramming and charting tool
- 👩🏻‍💻 [Microsoft FAST](https://www.fast.design/) - built on web components
- 💟 [Medusa](https://medusajs.com/) - digital commerce
- 🍕 [Open Sauced](https://opensauced.pizza/) - open source intelligence platform
- 💅🏻 [PenPot](https://penpot.app/) - design & prototyping platform
