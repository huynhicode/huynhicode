# Steph Huynh — UX Engineer

UI systems and accessible product UI

## Bio

Hi, I’m Steph. My background spans design and front-end engineering, so I’m usually thinking about both sides at once: UX clarity and implementation details.

I build scalable UI foundations like design systems, component libraries, and reusable patterns, with accessibility and maintainability as defaults.

## Focus areas

- Design systems and component libraries
- Accessible, responsive UI
- Documentation and implementation standards
- Bridging design intent and engineering execution
