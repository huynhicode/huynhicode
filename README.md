### Hello 👋

I'm Steph, a UX Engineer. I love being at the intersection of design and development.

I am a big fan of open source technology and design systems.

Here are a few of my favorite open source tools:

- 🧜‍♀️ [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) - diagramming and charting tool
- 👩🏻‍💻 [Microsoft FAST](https://www.fast.design/) - built on web components
- 🍕 [Open Sauced](https://opensauced.pizza/) - open source intelligence platform
- 💅🏻 [PenPot](https://penpot.app/) - design & prototyping platform

Here are some great design system resources:

- [Awesome Design Systems](https://github.com/alexpate/awesome-design-systems)
- [Design Systems Repo](https://designsystemsrepo.com/design-systems/)
- [Design System on Figma Community](https://www.designsystems.com/open-design-systems/)
