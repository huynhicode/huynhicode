# Steph Huynh - UX Engineer

**UX Engineering, from idea to interface**

Hi, I’m Steph. My background spans design, front-end engineering, and building design systems. I’m driven by curiosity and a desire to make digital experiences more accessible, maintainable, and genuinely useful.

I care about the details, how a component feels, how a system scales, and how design becomes real in the browser. My approach is shaped by real-world constraints, honest feedback, and a belief that great UX is as much about process as it is about polish.

**What I do**
- Build design systems and reusable component libraries
- Create accessible, responsive UI with strong UX polish
- Document patterns, decisions, and implementation details
- Bridge design intent and engineering execution

**How I work**
- Start with clarity, goals, constraints, and edge cases
- Build iteratively in small, testable slices
- Document as I go, from sketches to shipped code
- Test and refine components in Storybook

**Guiding Principles**
- Polish UX details and handle edge cases thoughtfully
- Turn design systems into practical, maintainable code
- Document and share patterns, decisions, and lessons learned
- Let progress and learning drive the work
