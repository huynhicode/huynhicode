### Hello 👋

I'm a UX Engineer with a deep commitment to enhancing digital experiences. My role involves seamlessly merging the worlds of design and engineering to create user-friendly interfaces. I specialize in crafting designs that not only look visually appealing but also function flawlessly. I'm passionate about understanding user behavior through research, allowing me to iterate on designs and ensure that products and websites are not just engaging but also accessible to a diverse user base. My expertise lies in bridging the gap between design and development, ultimately delivering interactive, user-centered solutions that elevate the overall digital experience.

I am a big fan of open-source technology; here are a few of my favorite tools:

- 🧜‍♀️ [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) - diagramming and charting tool
- 👩🏻‍💻 [Microsoft FAST](https://www.fast.design/) - built on web components
- 💟 [Medusa](https://medusajs.com/) - Shopify alternative
- 🍕 [Open Sauced](https://opensauced.pizza/) - open source intelligence platform
- 💅🏻 [PenPot](https://penpot.app/) - design & prototyping platform
